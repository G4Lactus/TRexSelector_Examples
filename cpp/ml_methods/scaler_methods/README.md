# Scaler Methods: Demonstration Suite

## Overview

This folder contains C++ examples for **column-wise scaling and normalization** utilities in the `ml_methods` module.

These preprocessing methods are used to standardize features before downstream tasks such as penalized regression, and
other numerical linear-algebra workflows. The current demo illustrates both variance-based standardization and
norm-based normalization.

## Key concepts

Given a data matrix $\boldsymbol{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$, scaling is applied column by column.

Two core transformations are demonstrated:

- **Z-score scaling**:

  ```math
  \tilde{x}_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij} - \bar{x}_j}{s_j},
  ```

  where $\bar{x}_j$ is the column mean and $s_j$ is the column scale.

- **Lp-norm scaling**:

  ```math
  \tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}_j =
  \frac{\boldsymbol{x}_j - \bar{x}_j \mathbf{1}}
  {\lVert \boldsymbol{x}_j - \bar{x}_j \mathbf{1} \rVert_p},
  ```

  when centering is enabled.
