# ML Methods: Demos

## Overview

This folder contains the `trex::ml_methods` layer of the C++ project.

It provides the numerical and preprocessing components that support higher-level T-Rex workflows, including column
scaling, singular value decomposition, principal component analysis, ridge regression, model parameter selection based
on k-fold cross-validation, and hierarchical agglomerative clustering.

Each method family has its own subfolder. Demo programs illustrate usage and interface behavior. Cross-language
correctness checks against R references live in the TRexSelector library's own test suite (`cpp/tests/validation/`),
run on demand via its `run_validations` target, rather than in this examples package.

## Category overview

| Category | Folder | Purpose |
| -------- | ------ | ------- |
| **Scaler Methods** | [scaler_methods/](scaler_methods/README.md) | Column normalization utilities, including Z-score and Lp-norm scaling |
| **PCA** | [pca/](pca/README.md) | Principal component analysis |
| **SVD** | [svd/](svd/README.md) | Singular value decomposition for stable matrix computations |
| **Ridge Regression** | [ridge_regression/](ridge_regression/README.md) | L2-penalized least-squares regression |
| **Model Selection** | [model_selection/](model_selection/README.md) | Cross-validation workflows for regularized regression methods |
| **HAC Clustering** | [hac_clustering/](hac_clustering/README.md) | Hierarchical agglomerative clustering, including large-scale memory-mapped workflows |

## Architecture context

These components form the `ml_methods` layer in the project structure:

```txt
utils -> ml_methods -> tsolvers -> trex_selector_methods -> demos
```

In particular:

- scaler methods support feature normalization before downstream modeling,
- SVD and ridge-related tools support stable regression and dimensionality-reduction workflows,
- HAC clustering supports grouped-variable workflows such as GVS.

## Building

```bash
cd TRexSelector_Examples/cpp
cmake -S . -B build/debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<path-to-TRexSelector>/cpp/install"
cmake --build build/debug
```

---

## Running

Run any demo executable from the build tree. For example:

```bash
./build/debug/bin/ml_methods/pca/demo_mlm_pca_01/demo_mlm_pca_01
```
