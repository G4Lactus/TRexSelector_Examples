# Screen-TRex: Variable Screening Demonstration Suite

## Overview

This folder contains C++ example programs for **Screen-TRex**, the T-Rex Selector extended with a
 variable-**screening** step for ultra-high-dimensional data, according to [[1]](#references).

Screen-TRex targets settings where $p$ is so large that running the classical T-Rex selector directly is
 impractical — genome-wide or biobank-scale designs — by first thresholding a dummy-based voting statistic
 to reduce the candidate set.
 Unlike the classical T-Rex selector, **screening has no target-FDR parameter**: it thresholds the voting
 statistic instead of calibrating to a user-specified level, and reports its own *estimated FDR* alongside
 the selection. Whether that self-estimate can be trusted is a central question of this suite, and the
 answer depends sharply on the correlation structure of the design (see Demos 01 and 03).

The demos in this folder are designed to help users understand:

1. how the **Ordinary** (majority-vote) and **Bootstrap-CI** thresholding rules behave, in memory and
    memory-mapped,
2. how screening degrades under **correlated designs**, and how far the **dependency-aware (DA)** variants
    can correct it,
3. how the **Biobank** workflow ("Algorithm 1") adaptively routes each of many phenotypes through
    Ordinary → Bootstrap-CI → classical T-Rex fallback,
4. how the choice of underlying T-Rex **solver backend** (TLARS, TAFS, TOMP) shifts the power/FDR operating
    point.

If you are new to this folder, start with **Demo 01** for the baseline comparison, then **Demo 03** for the
 correlation results, then **Demo 04** for the biobank workflow.

## What this folder covers

- **Baseline screening** (Demos 01–02): Ordinary vs. Bootstrap-CI on an i.i.d. Gaussian design, in memory
   and memory-mapped.
- **Correlation robustness** (Demo 03): plain screening vs. the dependency-aware variants under AR(1),
   equicorrelated, and block-equicorrelated designs, swept over both SNR and correlation strength.
- **Multi-phenotype biobank screening** (Demos 04–05): Algorithm 1's adaptive routing applied to several
   phenotypes sharing one design matrix, in memory and memory-mapped.
- **Solver sensitivity** (Demo 06): whether the T-Rex backend (TLARS, TAFS, TOMP) changes screening
   performance.

## Statistical model and targets

### The linear model

All demos use the same Gaussian linear model as the classical T-Rex selector:

```math
\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon},
\qquad
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{0}, \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 \boldsymbol{I}_n).
```

### Notation

- $n$: number of observations, $p$: number of variables, $s$: number of truly active variables.
- $\boldsymbol{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$: design matrix, $\boldsymbol{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$: response.
- $\mathcal{A} = \{ j : \beta_j \neq 0 \}$: true active support; $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}$: selected set.
- $\Phi_j$: dummy-based voting proportion for variable $j$ — the evidence T-Rex accumulates internally.
- $\rho$: correlation strength (AR(1) lag-1, equicorrelation, or within-block equicorrelation).
- $\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2$: noise variance, calibrated to a target SNR.

### Correlation models

- **i.i.d. Gaussian** (Demos 01, 02, 04–06): $X_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$, no correlation structure.
- **AR(1)** (Demo 03): $x_j = \rho\, x_{j-1} + \sqrt{1-\rho^2}\, w_j$, so columns correlate as
  $\rho^{|j - j'|}$.
- **Equicorrelated** (Demo 03): $x_j = \sqrt{\rho}\, z + \sqrt{1-\rho}\, w_j$ with one shared latent factor
  $z$, so every pair of columns correlates as $\rho$.
- **Block-equicorrelated** (Demo 03): the same construction with one latent factor per block, so columns
  correlate as $\rho$ within a block and are independent across blocks.

### Signal-to-noise ratio

As elsewhere in this project,
 $\mathrm{SNR} = \mathrm{Var}(\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}) / \mathrm{Var}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})$,
 with $\sigma_{\varepsilon}$ calibrated to hit a target SNR for a fixed $(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta})$.

### False discovery rate and true positive rate

```math
\mathrm{FDR} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{|\widehat{\mathcal{A}} \setminus \mathcal{A}|}{\max\{1, |\widehat{\mathcal{A}}|\}}\right],
\qquad
\mathrm{TPR} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{|\mathcal{A} \cap \widehat{\mathcal{A}}|}{\max\{1, |\mathcal{A}|\}}\right].
```

### What is actually measured in these demos

> **Screening returns a candidate set, and every rate is evaluated on individual variables.** The quantity
> Screen-TRex thresholds is the voting proportion $\Phi_j$, and what it returns is a set of variable
> indices; $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ above are therefore sets of *variables*. A false
> discovery is a selected variable that is not truly active.
>
> Screen-TRex additionally reports an **estimated FDR** — its own internal assessment of the selection's
> error rate. Every figure in this folder plots it (dashed) against the realized FDR (solid), because the
> two can diverge severely: conservative on i.i.d. designs, but wildly optimistic under equicorrelation
> (Demo 03).
>
> In the biobank demos, FDR/TPR are accumulated **conditionally** on which method a phenotype was routed
> to, alongside the unconditional **Usage %**. A conditional rate over a route that handled no phenotypes
> at a given SNR is an average over an empty set, not a failure.

## Screen-TRex specific concepts

- **`ScreenTRexMethod`** — the screening variant: `TREX` (ordinary voting-based screening, with or without
   the bootstrap rule) and the dependency-aware variants `TREX_DA_AR1`, `TREX_DA_EQUI`,
   `TREX_DA_BLOCK_EQUI` (Demo 03).
- **Ordinary vs. Bootstrap-CI** (`ScreenTRexControlParameter::use_bootstrap_CI`) — the **Ordinary** rule
   thresholds at $\Phi_j > 0.5$; the **Bootstrap-CI** rule builds a bootstrap confidence band
   (`R_boot = 1000` replicates, grid granularity `ci_grid_step = 0.001`) around the estimated FDR curve and
   picks its threshold from that band.
- **Dependency-aware (DA) screening** (`rho_thr_DA`, `n_blocks`) — pre-groups strongly correlated variables
   before voting, so redundant correlated variables do not split the evidence.
- **Biobank / "Algorithm 1"** (`BiobankScreenTRexControl`, Demos 04–05) — screens **multiple phenotypes
   against one shared design matrix**. Per phenotype it tries Screen-TRex Ordinary; if the estimated FDR
   falls outside `[lower_bound_FDR, upper_bound_FDR]` it tries Bootstrap-CI; failing that it falls back to
   the classical T-Rex selector at `target_FDR_trex`. The share routed to each method is reported as
   **Usage %**.

All six demos are Monte Carlo studies (200 repetitions per grid point); every result in this folder was
 produced by the committed sources.

---

## Building the demos

From the C++ workspace root:

```bash
cd TRexSelector_Examples/cpp
cmake -S . -B build/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<path-to-TRexSelector>/cpp/install"
cmake --build build/release
```

The executables mirror the source tree under the `bin/` directory:

```txt
build/release/bin/trex_selector_methods/trex_screening/<demo_folder>/<demo_name>
```

---

## Running a demo

For example, to run Demo 01:

```bash
./build/release/bin/trex_selector_methods/trex_screening/demo_trex_scr_01_mc_sim_screen_trex/demo_trex_scr_01_mc_sim_screen_trex
```

Every demo writes a human-readable `.txt` summary and a tidy `.csv` table into its local
`simulation_results/data/` folder. To run all six back to back as an unattended job, use
`./run_scr_demos_overnight.sh` (rebuilds the targets, logs each demo, keeps the machine awake, and prints a
summary table of exit codes and wall-clock times).

Note that the selector draws its dummies from a nondeterministic seed, so re-running a demo reproduces the
 reported behaviour but not the exact digits.

### Figures

Each demo folder has a `generate_plots.sh` that renders its figures from the saved CSVs into
`simulation_results/plots/` using the shared `trex_scr_plt_utils.py` and the repo-root `.venv`
(matplotlib + pandas + numpy):

```bash
cd demo_trex_scr_01_mc_sim_screen_trex
./generate_plots.sh
```

`trex_scr_plt_utils.py` auto-detects the CSV shape: sweep results render as a TPR panel and an FDR panel
(realized solid, estimated dashed), while the biobank results add a third Usage-% panel and shade the
routing window.
